# A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks
---

alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial networks, borrrowing from style transfer literature.
â†’ an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes

it enables intuitive, scale-specific **control** of the synthesis.

better quality as well. This paper also provides methods to quantify interpolation quality and **disentanglement** and highly varied adn high-quality dataset of human faces.
